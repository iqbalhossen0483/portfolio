                        <p>
                            I am doing Honours on Economics in Dhaka College. My passion is to learn technology so I am doing MERN Stack Web Development with my academic career. As the position is a Web Developer role my keen attention to design and developing knowledge will be an added advantage for me to serve you with a quality-oriented service. I completed a complete MERN Stack Web Development course in <a href='https://web.programming-hero.com'>Programming-hero</a>. Like I said, my passion is to learn new technology. I am implementing various packages and tools after completing that course. Still now I am learning because I believe that learning has no end. I have that ability to learn new technology within a short time if I face something that is new for me. I have that quality to stick to something until I finish it and I feel good to do this. Thatâ€™s how I solve various problems and increase my knowledge.
